RAPID MINER 5.0 INSTALLATION NOTES
----------------------------------

This file describes the installation of RapidMiner on your machine. You may
install RapidMiner for all users of your system or for your own account 
locally.

Basically, there are two different ways of installing RapidMiner:

* Installation of a Windows executable
* Installation of a Java version (any platform)

Both ways are described below. More information about the installation 
of RapidMiner can be found at http://rapidminer.com


Installation of the Windows executable
--------------------------------------

Just perform a double click on the downloaded file 
  
     rapidminer-XXX-install.exe
     
and follow the installation instructions. As a result, there will be
a new menu entry in the Windows startmenu. RapidMiner is started by 
clicking this entry.


Installation of the Java version
--------------------------------

We assume that you have managed to unpack your downloaded archive,
because otherwise you would not be able to read these lines. 

The directory that was created contains the following files and
directories:

	scripts/*   Executable start scripts
	lib/		Java libraries and jar files
	lib/plugins	RapidMiner plugins
	etc/		Configuration and template files
	sample/*	sample experiments
	sample/data	sample data
    src/        java sources (source version only)
	INSTALL.txt this file
	README.*	Readme files for used libraries
	LICENSE.txt	The GNU public license
	CHANGES.txt	Changes from previous versions

1. Make sure you have Java installed. RapidMiner runs on Java 7.0 
   (aka 1.7) or higher. Type "java -version" on the command line to 
   figure out your Java version. A Java Runtime Environment can 
   be downloaded from http://java.sun.com/
   Make sure your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to point to
   the correct location (i.e. the installation directory of Java).

2. You can start RapidMiner using the executable jar file 
   lib/rapidminer.jar. On some operating systems, double clicking 
   on lib/rapidminer.jar starts RapidMiner.
   If that does not work, you can try typing something like
       java -jar lib/rapidminer.jar
   If that does not work, you can use the start scripts in the 
   scripts directory. On a MS Windows system use 
   scripts\rapidminer.bat and scripts\RapidMinerGUI.bat, 
   on a Unix system use scripts/rapidminer and scripts/RapidMinerGUI.
   
   Please note that you might have to set the executable flags on
   Unix systems for these scripts before you can use them. 

   (Optional) If you want to run RapidMiner from anywhere on your 
   system, add the scripts directory to your path.

3. Test your installation. Use
 
   scripts/rapidminer PROCESS   
   
                             to execute an process with the
                             command line version. You can use one
			                 of the samples from the samples 
			                 directory.
			                 
   scripts/RapidMinerGUI     
                         
                             to start the graphical user interface 
                             of RapidMiner (or make a double click on
                             lib/rapidminer.jar if this works on your 
                             operating system).

4. If you have downloaded any of the additional RapidMiner plugins, just
   copy the <plugin_name>.jar file to the directory lib/plugins.

5. If you downloaded the source version, you can compile the sources 
   using 'ant build' or 'ant dist'. Ant is a java build tool (like 
   'make') and can be downloaded from http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/
   RapidMiner requires Ant version 1.6 or higher.


NOTE ON CONFIGURATION FILES:
----------------------------
RapidMiner looks for the following configuration files and reads them in 
this ordering

  RAPID_MINER_HOME/rapidminerrc
  RAPID_MINER_HOME/rapidminerrc.OSNAME
  ~/.RapidMiner5/<VERSION>rapidminerrc
  ~/.RapidMiner5/<VERSION>rapidminerrc.<OSNAME>
  rapidminerrc
  rapidminerrc.<OSNAME>

Where <OSNAME> is the name of your operating system, <VERSION> the current
version and ~ is your home directory. You can see which files are read 
when RapidMiner starts.
